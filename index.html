<h1> Alex J Watras </h1> 

Full webpage coming soon. In the mean time, here is a joke:

Heisenberg, Ohm, and Schrödinger are in a car on a highway. They get pulled over. Heisenberg is driving and the police officer asks him "Do you know how fast you were going?"

"No, but I know exactly where I am" Heisenberg replies.

The police says "You were doing 130 in 80." Heisenberg throws up his hands and shouts "Great! Now I'm lost!"

The officer thinks this is suspicious and orders him to pop open the trunk. He checks it out and says "Do you know you have a dead body back here?"

"We do now!" shouts Schrödinger.

The officer moves to arrest them. Ohm resists.
